**Title:**  
**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing for Used Car Dataset**

---

## 1. Introduction  
Real-world datasets are usually messy: they contain missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistent formats. This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a used car dataset for analysis and machine learning.

---

## 2. Objectives  
- Handle missing values.  
- Fix inconsistent entries.  
- Convert data to correct formats.  
- Detect and treat outliers.  
- Encode categorical variables.  
- Scale numeric features.  
- Add new useful features.  

---

## 3. Methodology  
1. **Inspection** – Checked data structure, types, and missing values.  
2. **Cleaning** – Fixed `Price` formatting, standardized `Location`, filled missing values, and removed duplicates.  
3. **Outliers** – Applied IQR method to cap extreme values in `Price` and `Odometer`.  
4. **Encoding** – Converted `Location` into dummy variables.  
5. **Feature Engineering** – Added `CarAge`, `Is_City`, and `LogPrice`.  
6. **Scaling** – Standardized numeric features (except price-related).  
7. **Export** – Saved clean dataset as **Cars_Clean.csv**.

## 4. Results  
- All missing values handled.  
- Inconsistent location names corrected.  
- Outliers clipped to reasonable ranges.  
- Dataset enriched with new features.  
- Final dataset is structured, consistent, and ready for machine learning tasks.

## 5. Conclusion  
The preprocessing steps improved data quality and made the dataset suitable for predictive modeling and analysis. This process ensures reliable insights for car price prediction and decision-making.
