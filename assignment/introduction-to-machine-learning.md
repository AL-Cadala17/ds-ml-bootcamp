# Research Assignment: Introduction to Machine Learning

## Instructions
- **Do not use** the explanations or examples we provided earlier (e.g., classroom notes).  
- You must conduct **deep research** using books, scholarly articles, and reliable sources.  
- **You may use AI tools**, but **do not rely blindly**: do not submit answers you don’t fully understand or verify.  
- The purpose is for you to **learn through research** — therefore, explain ideas clearly, restate key concepts in your own words, and reference the sources you used.  
- Write in **English**, in a research-oriented style (with headings, paragraphs, and tables/figures where appropriate), and include **references** at the end.  

1. Define **Machine Learning** using a real-life example.  

2. Compare **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning**, giving an example of each.  

3. What causes **Overfitting**? How can it be prevented?  

4. Explain how **training data** and **test data** are split, and why this process is necessary.  

5. Find one **case study** (research paper or article) that explains how Machine Learning has been applied in healthcare, business, or transportation. Summarize its findings.
